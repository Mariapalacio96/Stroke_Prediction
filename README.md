# Stroke_Prediction


























We chose to use supervised machine learning because our data has a discrete outcome. Whether or not a patient had a stroke given certain characteristics. The machine learning model that had the most success predicting stroke results was the random forest model. It made the correct prediction 76% of the time vs. all of the other models we tried which were correct (55% to 74%) of the time.
