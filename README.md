# Stroke_Prediction

## Deliverable 1

### Topic

We picked a dataset of patient stroke data found on Kaggle: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

From a data analyst student perspective, we were provided with a robust, relatively clean set of data covering 10 characteristics of over 5,000 individuals, which should give us plenty of useful information to work with.

From a real world perspective, obviously strokes are a very serious issue.  According to the CDC's [Stroke Facts](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm), nearly 800,000 strokes occur in the United States on an annual basis.  Of those, there is approximately a 15% 30-day mortality rate.  Even for people who survive, many can be left with either very long roads to recovery or ultimately serious long-term disability.  By helping to uncover what factors are more likely to lead to strokes, we ultimately hope to help people avoid them in the first place.

### Description of Data

This data shows demographic and health information about 5,100 patients and whether or not they had a stroke. The demographic information is age, marital status, gender, work type and residence type. Health information is hypertension, heart disease, blood sugar, bmi and whether or not they smoke. In the data set a 1 indicates the patient has had a stroke and a 0 indicates they have not had a stroke.

### Questions to Answer
* Given the information we have started with, can we create a machine learning program which accurately predicts which people have had a stroke (or are likely to)?
* Which factors have a statistically significant correlation on the result of having a stroke, and what is that correlation?
* Do some factors correlate more with having a stroke than others?

### Communication Process

In addition to divvying up main responsibilities and setting up our GitHub repository with separate branches, we set up a few plans for communication.  We established a Slack group chat for quick and easy communication and the sharing of information.  We also made plans for a Zoom chat on Sunday go over things and make sure everything is in order before we submit our progress so far.
